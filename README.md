![](assets/)



## ABOUT

The objective was to create a restaurant page, with a focus on incorporating JavaScript modules and usage of webpack to compile files. The features of this page include:

- Working tab links that load different contents via DOM manipualtion.
- A drinks section that toggles between two menus - drinks and a wine list
- <select> tags that allow users to select number of guests from a dropdown menu as well as time of reservation
- Google iframes that highlight a hypothetical location of the restaurant that can be interacted with.
