# RESTAURANT PAGE

![](assets/)



## ABOUT

The objective was to create a restaurant page, with a focus on incorporating JavaScript modules and usage of webpack to compile files. The features of this page include:

- Working tab links that load different contents via DOM manipualtion.
- A drinks section that toggles between two menus - drinks and a wine list
- <select> tags that allow users to select number of guests from a dropdown menu as well as time of reservation
- Google iframes that highlight a hypothetical location of the restaurant that can be interacted with.






## OBJECTIVE

> *The primary purpose of this assignment was to minimise the use of globally scoped variables, instead utiliising as many factory fucntions as possible. The programme has been wrapped in an object ***playGame()*** that can be called anytime during the code.*

## FOCUS TOPICS

- Intermediate level use of HTML and CSS stylings
- CSS grid layout.
- Objects, object constructors and classes.
- DOM manipulation & events.
- Arrays.
- User inputs to instantiate objects.
